    title: BAM - Benchmarking Argument Mining
    summary: Benchmarking Argument Mining.
    description: In this paper, we present BAM, a unified Benchmark for Argument Mining (AM). We propose a method to homogenize both the evaluation process and the data to provide a common view in order to ultimately produce comparable results. Built as a four stage and end-to-end pipeline, the benchmark allows for the direct inclusion of additional argument miners to be evaluated. First, our system pre-processes a ground truth set used both for training and testing. Then, the benchmark calculates a total of four measures to assess different aspects of the mining process. To showcase an initial implementation of our approach, we apply our procedure and evaluate a set of systems on a corpus of scientific publications. With the obtained comparable results we can homogeneously assess the current state of AM in this domain.

    title: DREAM - Deployment of Recombination and Ensembles in Argument Mining
    summary: Improving Argument Mining.
    description: Current approaches to Argument Mining (AM) tend to take a holistic or black-box view of the overall pipeline. This paper, in contrast, aims to provide a solution to achieve increased performance based on current components instead of independent all-new solutions. To that end, it presents the Deployment of Recombination and Ensemble methods for Argument Miners (DREAM) framework that allows for the (automated) combination of AM components. Using ensemble methods, DREAM combines sets of AM systems to improve accuracy for the four tasks in the AM pipeline. Furthermore, it leverages recombination by using different argument miners elements throughout the pipeline. Experiments with five systems previously included in a benchmark show that the systems combined with DREAM can outperform the previous best single systems in terms of accuracy measured by an AM benchmark.

    summary: Multimodal knowledge graph store and query engine.
    description: Multimodal knowledge graphs often separate easily represented information (text) from that which is not (multimedia documents like images, videos, or audio). This severely limits query expressiveness, as the engines lack access to the node contents stored externally. We present MeGraS, the MediaGraph Store, a novel storage and query engine for multimodal knowledge graphs. By storing multimedia documents directly in the graph, MeGraS allows the query engine to leverage their content for enhanced capabilities, making it natively capable of performing operations such as k-NN, segmentation, or deriving non-materialized relations based on visual features. To demonstrate this, we incorporate and extend the pattern matching query language SPARQL, resulting in a unified framework for storing and managing multimodal knowledge graphs with advanced expressiveness.

    summary: Frontend for the retrieval of lifelog events from multimodal knowledge graphs.
    description: Lifelogging, the practice of recording parts of the subjective daily life, generates rich, multimodal data, but poses significant challenges for efficient retrieval. Building upon the LifeGraph series, this paper presents the fifth iteration, which introduces a novel user interface to facilitate intuitive and powerful querying of lifelogs from multimodal knowledge graphs. We showcase how this frontend, powered by our custom MediaGraph store, seamlessly exposes and leverages SPARQL capabilities. Through interactive demonstration scenarios, we illustrate how users can easily construct complex and expressive queries that also include advanced features such as similarity-based search, near-duplicate detection, and dynamic content extraction, all the while using native SPARQL syntax. This work highlights LifeGraph 5's user-centric design and \megras's role in bridging gaps between complex knowledge graph operations and accessible multimodal lifelog exploration.
